In this project I built a dashboard identifying the backward areas needing urgent attention.
For this project i took the Census 2011 data set from the Goverment of India website and used tools like Talend Data Integration, Rapid Miner Server etc and implemented K-means clustering Algorithms to identify the regions.

Here i have attached the report for the same showing the different clusters that were formed that helped in identifying backward areas.
